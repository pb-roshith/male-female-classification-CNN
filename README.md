# male-female-classification-CNN

there are more than 47,000 images in the dataset but i use only 7000 images because my ram in colab is full and crashed.

so i reduce the dataset to 7000 images. 

3500 images for male and 3500 images for female (total 7000 images).

also i use only 15 epochs , if you want to get higher accuracy, increase the size of the epochs.
